This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling.  The `strpos()` function returns `false` if the needle is not found, but `false` can also be interpreted as 0 in a boolean context. This leads to incorrect results when checking if a substring exists.

```php
<?php
$haystack = "This is a test string";
$needle = "test";

if (strpos($haystack, $needle) ) {
  echo "Needle found!";
} else {
  echo "Needle not found!";
}

$haystack2 = "This is another string";
$needle2 = "missing";

if (strpos($haystack2, $needle2)) {
  echo "Needle found!";
} else {
  echo "Needle not found!";
}
?>
```
